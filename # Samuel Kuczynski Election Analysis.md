# Samuel Kuczynski Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

### The purpose of this audit was to help Tom with an automation of calculating results from the Colorado election polls. To do this we wanted to work on a more automated system than Excel. We decided to use Python to create scripts to allow calculations of all future polls & different statistics drawn from the results.

## Election Audit Summary

### We were able to use a multitude of different formulas to allow us to manipulate the data into an easy readable format. For all future elections you are able to use all of the current code included in this report, you will simply just need to supply the Python code with future CSV files with data in a similiar fashion. Two examples that we would want to use to potentially modify this script would be to have the names come through a generic format incase any names are potentailly mispelled.
